# Encription-Decription
Simple encript-decript programm. Works with command line arguments.

Syntax 
Command line arguments

-alg [shift] [unicode] <br />
Choosing shifting algorithm <br />
First algorithm shifts each letter by the specified number according to its order in the alphabet in circle. <br />
The second one  based on Unicode table. <br />

-in 
-out 
specify the full name of a file to read data and to write the result.

-mode [enc] [dec]
Determine the programâ€™s mode (enc - encryption, dec - decryption). 

-key [int]
Argument is an integer key to modify the message.

-data [String]
text or ciphertext within quotes to encrypt or decrypt.

If there is no -mode, the program work in enc mode.
If there is no -key, the program  consider that key = 0.
If there is no -data, the program assume that the data is an empty string.
If there is no -out argument, the program print data to the standard output.
If there are both -data and -in arguments, program prefer -data over -in.
If there is no -alg program default it to shift.
